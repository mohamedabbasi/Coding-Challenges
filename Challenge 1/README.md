# Problem Description:

You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:
For every word, the second and the last letter are switched (e.g Hello becomes Holle)
For every word, the first letter is replaced by its ASCII character code (e.g H becomes 72)

Example:

“72olle 103doo 100ya” → “Hello good day”
“82yade 115te 103o” → “Ready set go”
